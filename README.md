# Hubeta

Hubeta is a companion for therapists, parents, and teachers, offering AI-driven recommendations to support their unique needs. Tailored to assist during and outside therapy sessions, Hubeta provides personalised suggestions based on evidence-based practices.

This repository contains structured conversation flows exported from Turn.io in JSON format that are adhere to the Flow Interoperability Standard (https://flowinterop.org/) supported by USAID and UNICEF. The flows are designed for easy customization and integration into FLOIP-compatible chat software, such as the open-source Flow Runner (https://github.com/turnhub/flow_runner), or transcoded to third-party chat platforms.

## Who is Hubeta for?
For therapists, Hubeta enhances therapy practice by aligning recommendations with their specific requirements. Parents receive guidance on managing behaviours, finding engaging activities, and supporting their child's development. Teachers benefit from classroom management strategies, professional development resources, and collaboration techniques.


# Overview
This project allows developers and educators to:
1. Access to AI-driven conversations flows in JSON format. These are stored in the journeys/ directory.
2. Modify and personalize conversation flows using an open-source flow-runner.
3. Integrate customised flows into FLOIP-compatible chat software for scalable use.
   
The goal is to simplify creating interactive, responsive conversations tailored to educational and support contexts.
